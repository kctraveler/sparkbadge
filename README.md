# Sparkbadge 


Sparkbadges is a tool for create longitudinal status sparklines for your projects. For example:

![trend](examples/trend.svg)
![hist_trend](examples/hist_trend.svg)

The sparkline SVGs you create can then be implemented in a badge using a tool such as [google/pybadges](https://github.com/google/pybadges):

![commits](examples/commits.svg)
![build_time](examples/build_time.svg)

Sparkbadges was heavily influenced and inspired by [google/pybadges](https://github.com/google/pybadges) and the aesthetics of the [Shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields) project.
